    IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ME
        This is the ONLY file that I will use to validate your solution's implementation. Please keep in mind that only the changes done to this file
        will be tested, and if you modify anything in any other files those changes won't be taken in account when I validate your solution.
        Also, please do not rename the file.

        In a separate file (named answers.txt) answer the following questions for each function you implement:
            * What vulnerabilities can there be in that function 
                (take in account the fact that the function may not be vulnerable and explicitly say so if you consider it to be that way)
            * What specific mitigation you used for each of the vulnerabilities listed above
        
        For the function named 'get_language_php' which is already implemented make sure to answer and do all the steps required that are listed
        above the implementation.

    DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS
        When delivering your solution, please ensure that you create a .zip archive file (make sure it's zip, not 7z, rar, winzip, etc)
        with the name "LastnameFirstname.zip" (for example MunteaAndrei.zip or RatiuRazvan.zip) and in the root of the zip file please 
        add the student_delivery.php file modified by you (keep the name as it is) and answers.txt file where you answered the questions.
